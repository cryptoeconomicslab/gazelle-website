Gazelle is a scaling technology for blockchain based on Plasma and Optimistic Virtual Machine(OVM). Current scope of its functionality includes transfer of WrappedETH and ERC20 tokens.

Plasma is a second layer scaling solution which introduces **transaction aggregator** who recieves all the transactions happend off-chain and generate a merkle tree with all the transactions' hash as leaves of the tree. By submitting root of the tree to the main-chain periodically, all the users are assured to protect their assets on Plasma. You can find detailed discussion about plasma <a href="https://www.plasma.io/plasma.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>

Optimistic Virtual Machine(OVM) is the abstraction of Layer 2 dispute logic, designed to support all protocols using fraud-proof. Dispute logic is written by Predicate logic as proposition. Every proposition is claimed to the same smart contract called Adjudication Contract. They can prove as true or false under dispute logic.

<!-- TODO: where do we put the link to Plasma? -->

Gazelle provides several useful APIs for DApp developers to make use of scalability of Plasma. Basic API includes `deposit`, `transfer` and `exit`. Detailed API can be found [here](api/Plasma_Light_Client).
