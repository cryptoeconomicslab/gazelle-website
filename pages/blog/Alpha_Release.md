We introduce gazelle alpha release.

## What is gazelle?

**gazelle** is a blockchain application framework for real-world use cases. It provides  scalability and usability by utilizing off-chain technology. As our first step, this alpha release includes Plasma SDK that provides simple APIs for Plasma applications. APIs include `deposit`, `transfer` and `exit`. You can try out gazelle [here](https://gzle.io/docs/tutorial/cli-wallet/README).

## The goal of gazelle

**The ultimate goal of gazelle** is to provide a way to build highly scalable and usable blockchain applications by utilizing off-chain technology.

For scalability, we use off-chain technology such as Plasma just because it's fast and secure. For usability, we provide a way to combine multiple off-chain technology constructions to make use of strengths of different off-chain technologies. For instance, if you combine Plasma and channel, you can achieve instant finality capability with arbitrary participants. This wouldn't have been possible by using only Plasma or channel. Combination of different constructions is possible thanks to OGS as a fraud-proof verification base. You can find detailed discussion about OGS in Optimism blog(link).

## EF Grant program

We greatly appreciate that our project is supported by the Ecosystem Support Program of Ethereum Foundation from Jan 2020.

## Next Step

We are planning to release following milestones next quarter in 2020.

- Testnet (Contracts deployed on Testnet and running aggregator on Cloud)
- Advanced features: Custom transactions e.g. Atomic Swap, Fast Finality

***

- You can try simple Plasma transfer transaction on your laptop with the alpha version. [Let's try!](https://gzle.io/docs/getting-started/Try_Gazelle_In_Local)
- We are looking for a team collaborate with to make a great Plasma application. [Please contact us](mailto:info@cryptoeconomicslab.com)!
- We hope you can use the Testnet and more complex transactions at the next milestone!

Thank you very much for reading. This release is only a small part of gazelle framework. Stay tuned for next update!
